# admin-dashboard
The Odin Project's "Project: Admin Dashboard".  Primarily focused on CSS Grid.

Project URL:  https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard

This project was primarily about taking a design picture and replicating it with HTML and CSS.

The primary technologies used:
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Web Color Picker (to get exact color values from the design picture)
- SVG's:  Learning how to change their color and size.  Also where to get them from (material design website)
- Git and Github
- VSCode (Emmet being particularly useful for creating repeated "cards", or nav links, etc.  div.classname*6>img.svg-class+p.link-class (etc, like that.)  I assume this kind of thing may be generated with either front-end JS scripts or back-end scripts at some point to create a dynamic page with user accounts, etc.

I quite liked this project.  It took me a little less than 10 hours to replicate it to the best of my ability.  The most time consuming part was learning how to use SVG's, and how you can't use <img src="svg.svg"> tag and your style.css file to change the SVG.  You need to do it in the SVG file, or do it in-line, or use something oether than <img> tag.  I ended up just changing the svg files, but I will figure out a better solution later, as this would take a long time to change, if I had to change them all one by one.
